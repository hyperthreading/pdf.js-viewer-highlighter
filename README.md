# pdf.js-viewer-highlighter
Customizable highlights for the PDF.js viewer layer

I built this to add interactivity to PDF highlights.
When imported on PDF.js' `viewer.html`, It embed its own highligthing layer to the `textLayer` of `PDFPageView`.

You need to manually add a script tag to the `web/viewer.html` of PDF.js (a forked version of PDF.js can be found on my repos)
